Hi! I am currently a DPhil (PhD) student with Dr. Maurice Fallon at the University of Oxford. Previously I interned as an applied scientist at Amazon Research in Cambridge working on speech synthesis. Recently, I also interned at XYZ Reality in London developing correspondence estimation algorithms in images. I am very passionate about 3D perception, computer vision and machine learning. My work is related to point cloud registration, image correspondence estimation and object detection. I completed a MSc Artificial Intelligence degree at the University of Edinburgh and I hold a first class honours degree in computing science from the University of Aberdeen. My free time I spend playing volleyball, travelling and skiing.
